## Getting Started

Diving into development on Open Task Timer is rather straight forward thanks to the use of Electron Forge.

npm install -g electron-forge
```

Next, make sure you have the project dependencies installed:
```
npm install
```

Now you're ready to run the tests, start the application, package it, or build the installer(s):
```
npm test
npm start
npm run package
npm run make
```
